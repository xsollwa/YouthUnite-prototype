        <h2>Empowering Student Activists</h2>
        <p>Student activism and advocacy is about standing up for issues that matter to you, your peers, and your community. Use your voice to create positive change—whether it's in your school, local government, or even globally. Advocates raise awareness, challenge unfair systems, and drive impactful solutions to real-world problems.</p>

              <blockquote>
                  "As a student and the Director of Living Outside, I’ve been able to merge my passion for advocacy with meaningful action. Leading an organization that empowers youth to directly combat homelessness has shown me how much impact we can have, even while still in high school. Through my role, I’ve been able to organize events, lead volunteer efforts, and work alongside policymakers, all while rallying other young people to get involved in addressing one of the most overlooked issues in our communities."

              <blockquote>
                  "Earlier this month, SEAT hosted a briefing for Congressional staff to educate them about the importance of mental health and suicide prevention in regards to minority youth. We got some of the largest mental health organizations in the country to partner with us and were able to have a large sum of Congressional join us at the United States Capitol in Washington, D.C. to learn from youth voices from various backgrounds. Based on what they learned from our youth, they can craft policies that truly represent the populations they are serving."

                  "Organizing an event at Open Door Academy with my team of students was one of the most rewarding experiences I’ve had. Our goal was to educate students about cultural awareness and multiculturalism, and it was incredible to see the positive impact it had. Throughout the event, students engaged with the activities, asked questions. Seeing how much they enjoyed the experience and left with a bigger understanding of different cultures made all the hard work worth it!"
